        regional contests at any Asia site. However, a contestant can participate
        in, at most, two (2) Asian contest sites during a contest year. A

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A Student must be willing and able to compete in the World Finals.</li>
        <li>
          A sutdent must be enrolled in a degree program at the sponsoring
          institution with at least a half-time load. This rule is not to be
          construed as disqualifying co-op students, exchange students, students
          serving internships, or extramural students.
        </li>
        <li>
          A student may compete for only one institution during a contest year.
        </li>
        <li>

          compete.

          compete.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If a team has registered and does not cancel their registration at least
        ten (10) days before the contest date, and does not show up to the
        contest, this team's contestants will be disqualified for all other
        contest sites in the same contest year. Cancellation of registration does
        not qualify for any refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team members for the team advancing to the World Finals ust be
        identical to the members who participated in the Asia On-Site Regional
        Contest. No substitution or reserves will be allowed in the World Finals.
        ANy alteration to the team will disqualify the team in the World Finals.
        However, Asia Regional Contests may allow reserve team member
        registration and may allow substition of the team member in the Asia
        Regional Contest, provided that the team composition is entered in the
        ICPC registration system website, before the Regional On-Site Contest.
        Any change to the team after that regional contest is not allowed.

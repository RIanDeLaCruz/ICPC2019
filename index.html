        ten (10) days before the contest date, and does not show up to the
        contest, this team's contestants will be disqualified for all other
        contest sites in the same contest year. Cancellation of registration does

        identical to the members who participated in the Asia On-Site Regional
        Contest. No substitution or reserves will be allowed in the World Finals.
        ANy alteration to the team will disqualify the team in the World Finals.
        However, Asia Regional Contests may allow reserve team member
        registration and may allow substition of the team member in the Asia
        Regional Contest, provided that the team composition is entered in the
        ICPC registration system website, before the Regional On-Site Contest.
